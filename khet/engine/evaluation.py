"""
Python file for evaluation of the board state

TODO: Implement evaluation function

IDEAS:
Classical evaluation:
- Count number of pieces in each color
- Count number of pieces in each color that are active
- Count number of pieces within each color that are in the opponent's half

Advanced evaluation:
- Train a neural network to evaluate the board state
- Use a pre-trained neural network to evaluate the board state
- Generate a dataset of board states and their corresponding evaluations and train a neural network on it
